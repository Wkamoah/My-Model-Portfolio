# Winfred Kofi Amoah – Professional Modeling Portfolio

This repository hosts the official online modeling portfolio of **Winfred Kofi Amoah** — a Ghanaian model, actor, and creative based in Moscow. Built from scratch with a clear vision, this website is not just a digital resume — it’s a representation of quiet resilience, growth, and intention. It’s designed to showcase my current works, make booking seamless, and reflect a strong aesthetic standard that aligns with my personal brand.
